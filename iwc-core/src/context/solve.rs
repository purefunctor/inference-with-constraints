/// This algoritihm takes the [`Constraint`]s that have been generated so far
/// and performs the necessary steps to solve them. Different constraints may
/// emit different metadataâ€”for instance, unification constraints may insert
/// solutions for unification variables, while for instance constraints, they
/// can return the necessary instance dictionaries to be inserted at the value
/// level.
///
/// At a high-level, the [`Context::solve`] function operates by iteratively
/// solving constraints. It also takes into account queueing newly generated
/// constraints, as well as deferring constraints that require further context
/// before being solved.
